## About the Project

Dress Circle Sales-data-Analysis is a comprehensive report that provides valuable insights into the sales performance and customer trends of Dress Circle, an apparel store that operates both offline and online through various channels like Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.

The project involved real-time data collection from the store's database. Given the store's limited resources, I collaborated with Dress Circle to understand their challenges and pain points. Their main objective was to assess their sales performance and customer behavior in 2022, to strategize and drive sales growth in 2023.
